ALA Library Privacy Checklist For Public Computers and Networks

http://www.ala.org/advocacy/privacy/checklists/public-access-computer



## Priority 1 Actions


Use analog signage and/or splash screens to explain the library's network and wifi access policies, including any privacy-related information.


Make a policy decision about the level of privacy versus convenience that the library will offer its wifi users and adequately warn users of potentials for traffic interception and other risks of an insecure network.


Set up public computers to purge downloads, saved files, browsing history, and other data from individual user sessions.  
Note: This can be accomplished on logout via the computer reservation system if the library uses such a system; by using restoration software such as CleanSlate or Deep Freeze; by configuring browsers to clear all history and other usage data upon exit.


Ensure that paper sign-up sheets for public computers, devices, or classes are destroyed when no longer needed.


Offer classes and other educational materials to users about best practices for privacy and security when using the library's public computers.


Offer privacy screens to patrons who desire to use them.



## Priority 2 Actions


Use antivirus software on all public computers.  
Note: Ensure that antivirus software that is installed has the ability to block spyware and keylogging software.

Win 10 should use Window's Defender


Ensure that any computer reservation management system records, print management  records, or ILS records in regards to computer use are anonymized or destroyed when no longer needed.


Configure any content filters to not collect or store browsing data.
Note: Some content filters send information to third parties, be aware of this and have a policy for it.


Anonymize or destroy transactional logs for network activity when no longer needed.


Perform regular security audits on all public computers, including digital inspection of security risks and flaws and physical inspection for unknown devices.



## Priority 3 Actions


Install plugins on public computers to limit third party tracking, enable private browsing modes, and force HTTPS connections.

HTTPS Everywhere: https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere

Privacy Badger: https://www.eff.org/privacybadger
Note: This is a little out of date as many of these functions are moving into browsers natively.

See guides about Firefox security options, e.g. https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/firefox/windows


Install the Tor browser on public computers as a privacy option for patrons.


Offer the privacy-oriented Tails OS on bootable USB or CDROM for use on public computers or patron devices.


Install malware-blocking, ad blocking, and anti-spam features on firewalls.


Segment the network to isolate staff computers, public computers, and wireless users into their own subnets.


Ensure that any applications and operating systems on public computers are disabled from automatically sharing activity data with software publishers (e.g. error reporting)

## Talkiing to IT folks

Note: 
Security vs Access
Logs vs Privacy


Know enough to ask the right questions


Have clear objectives and include the IT department in planning to achieve those goals


Bring it in house?
